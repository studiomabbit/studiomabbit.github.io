                    <p>Forrest Dils is level designer, composer, and artist who has been fascinated with the game design
                        process since he was a kid. He pulls inspiration from titles like Psychonauts, Mirror's Edge,
                        and an array of Valve franchises to bring charming visuals, captivating soundscapes, and
                        engaging gameplay elements to life. Forrest is now a fourth-year student at Purdue University
                        and has accrued a diverse set of skills working in Unreal, Godot, and Unity. Alongside this, his
                        intense interest into the limits of game programming has shaped a passion in glitch discovery
                        and bug testing. Forrest's work can be found displayed in several independent titles such as

                        UI updates across Unity, Unreal, and Godot. In his free time, he likes to play a wide variety of
